Kumar came in to help us out.

working with Arjan and Dylan to try to figure out how things are working together.

So far:

It looks like each x-tags thing is an element, with the associated methods.
thus this.ClassName will return the defined class name

document is page-wide.

Googling stuff: do MDN 'whatever you're actually looking for'
     because MDN isn't very searchable --Kumar

addEventListener with ('click' and function(e))
         -- function(e) is the standard way of passing information in about the event.
         -- e.target specifies where the event occured.

dl is the bigger dictionary, dd is the value stored at key dt.

innerHTML is a method that allows you to access and change the HTML of the element object it's attached to.

The "Panel" element in locally run demo.html does not work in Chrome (version 20.0.1132.47), but does work in Firefox.  Why?
--It's most likely Chrome denying cross-domain requests (since we're running it locally, while the src is on a server elsewhere).


So for June 10th, 2012

--decided to make a blog post or doc about creating an xtag for noobies.  Because we've got that.

Start with installation instructions:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/mozilla/x-tag

Super simple .js file -- defines essentially no behaviour, but reserves the word 'x-listview'

xtag.register('x-listview', {})

css to accomodate the scrollable behaviour:

Important css bits:

	  -- overflow: auto;
	  -- height: 100%;
	  -- width: 100%

Need to use the <p> tag or other specifier to get the menu item to take full width
(as opposed to plain text)

.gitignore:
	You can put anything in there as regex (* representing any character)
	Need to remember to escape hash characters (#) because they represent comments.

Remember how important India and Canada are in the development of lists.
	 -- DO NOT TAKE THOSE OUT OF THE DEMO.
