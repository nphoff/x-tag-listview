Kumar came in to help us out.

working with Arjan and Dylan to try to figure out how things are working together.

So far:

It looks like each x-tags thing is an element, with the associated methods.
thus this.ClassName will return the defined class name

document is page-wide.

Googling stuff: do MDN 'whatever you're actually looking for'
     because MDN isn't very searchable --Kumar

addEventListener with ('click' and function(e))
         -- function(e) is the standard way of passing information in about the event.
         -- e.target specifies where the event occured.

dl is the bigger dictionary, dd is the value stored at key dt.

innerHTML is a method that allows you to access and change the HTML of the element object it's attached to.

The "Panel" element in locally run demo.html does not work in Chrome (version 20.0.1132.47), but does work in Firefox.  Why?
--It's most likely Chrome denying cross-domain requests (since we're running it locally, while the src is on a server elsewhere).
