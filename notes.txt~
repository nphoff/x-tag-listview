Kumar came in to help us out.

working with Arjan and Dylan to try to figure out how things are working together.

So far:

It looks like each x-tags thing is an element, with the associated methods.
thus this.ClassName will return the defined class name

document is page-wide.

Googling stuff: do MDN 'whatever you're actually looking for'
     because MDN isn't very searchable --Kumar

addEventListener with ('click' and function(e))
         -- function(e) is the standard way of passing information in about the event.
         -- e.target specifies where the event occured.
